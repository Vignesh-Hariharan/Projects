# Data Projects

Portfolio of data projects demonstrating end-to-end pipeline development, analytics engineering, and data architecture.

## Projects

### [Project 1: Multi-Touch Attribution Engine](./attribution-analytics/)
Attribution analytics pipeline comparing credit allocation across models, highlighting how prospecting channels are consistently undervalued with traditional last-click analytics.

**Stack:** Python, Snowflake, dbt, Tableau   
**Skills Used:** Attribution modeling, dimensional modeling, advanced SQL (window functions), dbt transformations, Python ETL, Snowflake data warehousing, orchestration (bash/CLI), synthetic data generation
